Data Set Process Methods:
Data pre-processing:Data pre-processing includes cleaning,  normalization,  transformation,  feature extraction and selection, etc. 
The product of data pre-processing is the final training set.

Why Data Pre processing 
1)Real world data are generally
        Incomplete: lacking attribute values, lacking certain attributes of interest, or containing only aggregate data
        Noisy: containing errors or outliers
        Inconsistent: containing discrepancies in codes or names
2)Tasks in data pre processing
        Data cleaning: fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.
        Data integration: using multiple databases, data cubes, or files.
        Data transformation: normalization and aggregation.
        Data reduction: reducing the volume but producing the same or similar analytical results.
        Data discretization: part of data reduction, replacing numerical attributes with nominal ones.
Note : In our project we are using Data Reduction method for data cleaning
